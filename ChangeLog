	further changes applied

	* GaussHelmert.pm: verbose() can now take a filename as argument
	for the logfile.

	* example/line2d-estimation.pl: added some comments

	* GaussHelmert.pm: remove "number of contradictions/constraints"
	as parameters.  I can get this from the size of the vectors in $y
	and $b. Tested succesfully with Math::UncertainGeometry.
